# Online-MBDoE_PE
Python codes for online Model Based Design of Experiments compatible with the LabVIEW closed loop system
These codes include codes for parameter estimation, MBDoE for parameter precision and MBDoE for model discrimination using both the Hunter-Box and Buzzi-Ferraris criteria. All python files are specific to a case study. The case studies are the esterification of benzoic acid and ethanol with either sulfuric acid (homogenous reaction in a PFR) or with Amberlyst 15 (heterogenoeous catalysis in a string reactor). The case studies have a different number of parameters in their kinetic models, as well as a different number of input variables. However with some minor changes it is possible to alter the code for any case study with any number of parameters or control variables or measured variables.
